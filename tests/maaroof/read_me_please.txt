hi my name is maaroof, i wrote some tests that you can run to be extra 
sure that your code runs as intended.


	#files and folders:
1. MAGIC_TESTING_FOLDER: testing folder contains my tests (chessSystemTestsExample.c and the non server version that compares files automatically, cool ha?)
			map.h, chessSystem.h, test_utilities.h, libmap.a
2. MAGIC_TESTING_FOLDER/expected_outputs

3. MAGIC_TESTING_FOLDER/your_outputs

	#todo:
copy your map.c and chessSystem.c to MAGIC_TESTING_FOLDER

run the code. (chessSystemTestsExample.c(on server) or chessSystemTestsExample_nonServer.c(on VS)) 

	#notes: 
those are my tests, and my expected_outputs so it could be wrong!!
if you find a problem or a wrong test output, please tell me.
think of it as testing my testing program. ;)

feel free to add/modify tests and SHARE it with the rest of us,
i might too add or change tests in the future.

if you have any question feel free to ask.
